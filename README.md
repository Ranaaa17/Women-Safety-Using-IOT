Women safety using IoT is a smart security solution that employs Internet of Things technology to protect women in real-time. It uses wearable devices integrated with sensors, GPS, and communication modules to detect emergencies and send instant alerts. When a woman is in danger, the device can trigger an SOS signal that shares her live location and other critical data with family members, nearby police stations, or emergency services. This system ensures faster response times and continuous monitoring, enhancing the safety and confidence of women in both public and private environments.
